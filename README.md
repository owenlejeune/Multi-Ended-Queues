# OpenArrayDeque

OpenArrayDeque is a custom implementation of the Java ArrayDeque collection using the 'circular array' design.  It allows for fast add/remove operations near the front and end of the collection, but also allows for modification at any index.

# Treque

Treque utilizes the OpenArrayDeque to create a 'triple-ended' queue that allows for fast modification near the front, back, and middle of the collection.
