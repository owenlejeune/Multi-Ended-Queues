OpenArrayDeque is a custom implemtation of the Java ArrayDeque collection using the 'circular array' method that allows for fast add/remove near the front and end of the collection, but also allows for modification at any index.

Treque utilizes the OpenArrayDeque to create a 'triple-ended' queue that allows for fast modification near the front, back, and middle of the collection.
